Voice Assistant 
 What it does:
Takes text input (like "hello", "time", "date", or "google").
Replies back with a response.
How it works:
It runs inside a loop (while True) so you can keep talking to it.
If you type "hello" → it replies "Hello! How can I help you?"
If you type "time" or "date" → it shows the current time or date.
If you type "google" → it opens Google in your browser.
If you type "exit" → it says goodbye and stops.
